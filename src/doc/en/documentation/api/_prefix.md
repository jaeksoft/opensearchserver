The APIs are used to interface your application with your OpenSearchServer instance. There are two versions.

API v1 is the original. It includes some low-level features that are still used internally by OpenSearchServer, and will thus remain active. However, no new features should be added to it. This API should only be used by those developing internal OpenSearchServer features.

API v2 is the new REST API. RESTFUL implementation using this API allows for controlling every feature of OpenSearchServer. API v2 frequently receives upgrades and new features.
