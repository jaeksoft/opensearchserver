###Welcome to OpenSearchServer!

Integrating OpenSearchServer (OSS) as a search engine can be done within minutes.

This wiki documents the process and is constantly being updated, fixed and polished. All constructive contributions are of course welcome!

Its two main content areas are a/ a series of quick-start guides teaching the basics, and b/ the documentation proper with more in-depths resources.

Interested parties can refer to the Trademarks notice for this document.

####We are still building this documentation.

Until we finish regrouping the documentation, the older documents are still available:

- [Confluence documentation](http://www.open-search-server.com/confluence/display/EN/Home/)
- [REST API documentation](https://github.com/jaeksoft/opensearchserver/wiki)
