### Welcome to OpenSearchServer!

Integrating OpenSearchServer (OSS) as a search engine can be done within minutes.

This wiki documents the process and is constantly being updated, fixed and polished. All constructive contributions are of course welcome!

The main content areas are:
* a series of quick-start guides teaching the basics,
* the documentation proper with more in-depths resources.

Interested parties can refer to the Trademarks notice for this document.

The main chapters are:

* [Installation Guide](installation/README.md)
* [Getting started](tutorials/README.md)
* [Frequently Asked Questions](faq/README.md)
* [Clients libraries](clients/README.md)
* [API v1 (XML/HTTP)](api_v1/README.md)
* [API v2 (RESTFul JSON)](api_v2/README.md)

We are still building this documentation. Feel free to send feedback (positive or negative).

Until we finish regrouping the documentation, the older documents are still available :
